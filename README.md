## 🚀 What I’m Building

- **Agentic AI systems** – LLM-powered tools that reason over user context, call tools, and automate workflows end-to-end.
- **Production-ready apps** – From clean architecture and backend APIs to polished frontends and deployment.
- **ML-powered features** – Classification, recommendations, analytics, and automation baked directly into products.

I love taking projects from **idea → prototype → production**, with an emphasis on reliability, observability, and user experience.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 🎓 EduPersist AI – Student Persistence Prediction  
**Predicting Student Persistence:** Built machine learning models (Neural Networks and Random Forests) to predict whether students persist beyond their first year using academic and demographic data.  
- Tackled class imbalance and missing data, with Random Forests offering more stable and interpretable performance for stakeholders.  
- Highlighted ethical considerations, including demographic bias, and proposed fairness audits and transparency practices for real deployments.
