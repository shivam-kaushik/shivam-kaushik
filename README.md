## 🚀 What I’m Building

- **Agentic AI systems** – LLM-powered tools that reason over user context, call tools, and automate workflows end-to-end. [web:19][memory:3]
- **Production-ready apps** – From clean architecture and backend APIs to polished frontends and deployment. [memory:3][memory:9]
- **ML-powered features** – Classification, recommendations, analytics, and automation baked directly into products. [memory:6][memory:7]

I love taking projects from **idea → prototype → production**, with an emphasis on reliability, observability, and user experience. [memory:3][memory:9]

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 📈 Revana AI – Autonomous Analytics Engine  
**Multi-agent analytics system** that turns natural language questions into end-to-end data analysis.  
- Planner–Executor architecture converts questions into SQL, runs **forecasting with Facebook Prophet**, performs anomaly detection, and returns ready-to-use insights.  
- Uses **pgvector-based semantic search** for context-aware querying and generates interactive visualizations with Plotly and Chart.js.  
- Built with **FastAPI + LangChain** and a **hybrid LLM stack** (local models for cheap/low-latency tasks, GPT‑4o for complex reasoning) to balance speed, cost, and accuracy.
